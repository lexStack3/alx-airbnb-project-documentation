## 📌 Overview

The Airbnb Clone backend is designed to support the following:

### 🔑 Core Functionalities
- **User Management**: Secure registration and login (JWT, OAuth), profile management.
- **Property Listings**: Hosts can add, edit, and delete property listings.

- File storage for images (user profiles and property photos).
- Email service integration (e.g., SendGrid or Mailgun).
- Comprehensive error handling and logging.

### 🚀 Non-Functional Requirements
- Modular and scalable architecture.
- Performance optimization (e.g., caching with Redis).
- Strong security practices including encryption and rate limiting.
- Automated testing (unit, integration, and API tests).

## 🧩 Purpose

This documentation serves as a reference for understanding the architectural and functional scope of the backend system, and supports collaboration, development, and future scaling efforts.
